Hi! I am Ziyan ([pronounced](https://www.name-coach.com/ziyan-han-a7df4846-02c4-4590-bd57-5c53d50e2265) like "Tsee-Yen"). I hold a PhD from Nanjing University, advised by Prof. Hejiu Hui. My research centers on experimental petrology and isotopic geochemistry, particularly the volatile evolution of the Moon and other airless bodies.

My research interests mostly focus on:
* Origin and evolution of rocky planets;   
* Evaporation process in nebular and planetary process;   
* Formation of chondrules and CAI;   
* Intersection between high temperature experiments and isotopes in planetary science

When I'm not doing science, I enjoy hiking and birdwatching. You can check out some of the photos I've taken in the [Gallery](https://cyanhan.github.io/ZiyanHan/portfolio/). Feel free to join me for birding or nature observation if you spot me at a conference!
